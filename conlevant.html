    <h4>2.2 Some languages may be designated as "official" within an Ensate (see Section 3), leading to their use for enacting laws. When an official language is established within an Ensate, it becomes official for the entire nation.</h4>
    <h4>2.3 Official languages at the national level are promoted but not required for translations of this Constitution, subsequent additions to it, or nationwide laws.</h4>

    <h2>SECTION 3: ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNMENT</h2>
    <h4>3.1 The Levantine Kingdom is organized into Ensates, each ruled by an Ensi. All Ensis must pledge loyalty to the King of the Levant and abide by laws enacted by the national parliament or the King.</h4>
    <h4>3.2 The selection process for an Ensi may vary within each Ensate.</h4>
    <h4>3.3 An Ensi is a legal entity and must represent the interests of the entire Ensate. Upon assuming the position, every Ensi automatically becomes a citizen of the Levantine Kingdom.</h4>
    <h4>3.4 The Parliament consists of all Ensis and a democratically elected group of Parliamentarians. Each Ensate is entitled to a minimum of one Parliamentarian, with an additional Parliamentarian for every three individuals beyond that.</h4>

    <h2>SECTION 4: RIGHTS OF ALL</h2>
    <h4>4.1 No person shall be subjected to legal discrimination or punishment based on the following, as well as any other grounds not listed herein:</h4>

    <p class="sub">4.1.6 Any others not listed.</p>

    <h4>4.2 Every individual has the right to a fair trial for any offense listed in this Constitution or any other laws. However, the Levantine Kingdom reserves the right to detain individuals until their trial.</h4>
    <h4>4.3 Regardless of conviction, no person, including opposing military forces and criminals, shall be subject to unjust treatment, including but not limited to the following:</h4>
    <p class="sub">4.3.1 Holding in tighter custody than necessary under the law to prevent similar incidents, such as:</p>
    <p class="sub">4.3.1.1 Torture through continuous teleportation or confinement in a dangerous area.</p>
    <p class="sub">4.3.1.2 Holding hostages for purposes of bribery beyond what is permitted by law.</p>
    <p class="sub">4.3.2 Deprivation of essential sustenance required for survival.</p>

    <h4>4.4 Every citizen has the right to vote for their Parliamentarian.</h4>
    <h4>4.5 Every person, regardless of citizenship, has the right to freedom of speech that does not cause undue harm to others.</h4>

    <h4>4.7 Any violation of these rights against another person shall be considered a crime, in addition to any offenses listed as crimes in the laws of the Levantine Kingdom.</h4>

    <h2>IN CONCLUSION</h2>
    <p>We, the people of the Levantine Kingdom, adopt and uphold this Constitution as the foundation of our nation. With the spirit of unity and respect, we strive to safeguard the rights, freedoms, and dignity of all individuals within our borders, promoting a just and harmonious society for present and future generations.</p>
