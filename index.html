    <h1>CONSTITUTION OF THE KINGDOM OF THE LEVANT</h1>

    <h2>SECTION 1: CITIZENSHIP</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Any person may be granted citizenship or allowance for entry in the Levantine Kingdom proper without discrimination. Discrimination includes, but is not limited to,</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1.1.1 providing preference to members or non-members of any group laid out in (INSERT HERE)</li>
        <li>1.1.2 disallowing entry to the nation for members of any aforementioned group</li>
        <li>1.1.3 or showing any other sort of contempt or feelings towards someone in the field of travel & immigration inside or outside of our country</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1.2 All citizens & visitors are entitled to a certain list of rights listed out in (INSERT HERE).</h3>

    <h2>SECTION 2: LANGUAGE</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Any languages can be spoken inside of our nation. Discrimination against anyone based on the language they speak is strictly prohibited under (INSERT HERE).</h3>
    <h3>2.2 Some languages are considered "official" in that at least one of the Ensates (see (INSERT HERE)) sets it as mandatory that all laws must be put in these languages. Any language made official inside one of the Ensates becomes official for the whole nation.</h3>
    <h3>2.3 However, official languages on the national level are simply "promoted" & not required to be translated into all languages for the Constitution shown here, any subsequent additions to it, or nationwide laws.</h3>

    <h2>SECTION 3: ORGANIZATION & GOVERNMENT</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Our nation is organized in a system of Ensates, each of which is ruled over by an Ensi. All the Ensis must stay loyal to the King of the Levant & any laws they publish under the national parliament or of the King's own accord.</h3>
    <h3>3.2 Though all Ensates are monarchies by default, the Ensi may be selected by any means that the Ensate selects.</h3>
    <h3>3.3 The Ensi is a singular legal entity & must be representative of the Ensate as a whole. Any Ensi, even if not a legal entity before, automatically becomes one upon gaining their Ensidom. All Ensis become citizens upon entering the position as well.</h3>
    <h3>3.4 The Parliament is formed by all Ensis & a democratically elected group of Parliamentarians. Each Ensate gets a minimum of one Parliamentarian, & for every 3 more people, another Parliamentarian is gained.</h3>

    <h2>SECTION 4: RIGHTS OF ALL</h2>
    <h3>4.1 No legal discrimination or punishment can take place against anyone due to any of the following, including by</h3>

    </ol>

    <h3>4.4 Every citizen has the right to vote for their Parliamentarian.</h3>

    <h3>4.6 Every person has the right to carry on without unnecessary injury, whether as punishment beyond the law or by another person as a simple assault.</h3>
    <h3>4.7 If anyone violates these rules against somebody else, it is a crime, along with anything else listed as a crime in any laws.</h3>
